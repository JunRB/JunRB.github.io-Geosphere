<h2 style="color:Sienna;"><b><u>Composition of the Earth</b></u></h2>

<h2><b>Crust</b></h2>
<p>
This is the layer on which you stand on. All the mountain, jungles and oceans you know are carried <br>
on this layer. It is the thinnest layer of the four layers. This layer is 70 Km thick on the land, <br>
and 5 Km thick at some ocean floors. The crust is mostly composed of silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, and iron oxide (rust).
</p>
<h2><b>Mantle</b></h2>
<p>
This layer starts below the crust layer, and is denser than the crust. It is 3,000 Km in thickness. It is <br>
mostly made of silicate rocks rich in magnesium and iron. This layer is not a perfectly solid. At <br>
some locations, the rock is completely melted, which is called magma. When this magma reaches <br>
near the crust, it erupts as Lava from the volcanoes. In this layer, rocks are in constant motion.<br>
 They rise and sink due to internal heat from the core, and set up the convective currents. These <br>
 convective currents also cause the tectonic plates to move and crash into each other causing earthquakes.
</p>
<h2><b>Outer Core</b></h2>
<p>
This layer of the Earth is in a liquid state at a temperature of 5000 C. This layer is mostly made of <br>
iron and nickel. Both of these two metal are in a liquid state due to intense heat.<br>

The outer core is always in constant circulatory motion, which creates a magnetic field around the Earth.<br>
This magnetic field protects our Earth from the Sun’s deadly wind. Without this layer, our Earth couldn’t <br>
have a magnetic field. Without this magnetic field, our Earth could never have atmosphere, oceans, and life.
</p>
<h2><b>Inner Core</b></h2>
<p>
This is the hottest layer of the Earth, reaching a temperature of 7000 C; much hotter than the surface of the Sun. <br>
It is also composed of iron and nickel metal. But, this layer is in the solid state. Despite the fact that, it is the <br>
hottest part of the Earth. This is because the inner core is under tremendous pressure due to the weight of the other layers.
</p>

<h2 style="color:Sienna;"><b><u>Give a reason and an explanation for how ONE of the features helps life on earth.</u></b></h2>

<p>The Crust helps life on Earth because the Crust is what we are standing on right now, without it we would be walking <br>
on molten rock (lava). If we were to walk on lava there would no life on earth at all. The Crust also contains the dirt <br>
and soil plants such as vegetables and fruits grow. Therefore the Crust is an important thing to the life on Earth without<br>
it there would be no life on Earth at all.
